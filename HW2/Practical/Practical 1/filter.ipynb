    "While blurring can be an effective way to reduce noise in an image, it is often not desirable to blur the entire image, as important details and sharp edges may be lost. In such cases, bilateral filtering can make your life easier.\n",

    "This technique applies the filter selectively to blur similar intensity pixels in a neighborhood. Sharp edges are preserved, wherever possible.\n",
    "It lets you control not only the spatial size of the filter, but also the degree to which the neighboring pixels are included in the filtered output. This is done, based on variation in their color intensity, and also distance from the filtered pixel.\n",
    "Bilateral filtering essentially applies a 2D Gaussian (weighted) blur to the image, while also considering the variation in intensities of neighboring pixels to minimize the blurring near edges (which we wish to preserve). What this means is that the shape of the kernel actually depends on the local image content, at every pixel location.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s a concrete example. Assume, you are filtering a region in an image, near an edge. A simple Gaussian blur filter would blur the edge because it lies near the filtered region (close to the center of the Gaussian filter).  But the bilateral filter can sense the edge, because it also considers differences in pixel intensities. So, it will compute a much lower weight for the pixels straddling the edge, thereby reducing their influence on the filtered region. Regions of more uniform intensity are blurred heavier, as they are not associated with strong edges.\n",

    "The sigmaColor parameter defines the one-dimensional Gaussian distribution, which specifies the degree to which differences in pixel intensity can be tolerated.\n",
